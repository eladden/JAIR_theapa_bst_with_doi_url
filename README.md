# JAIR theapa.bst with doi&url
A new theapa style for JAIR papers, able to print the url and the doi fields
Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research is using citation style in latex that was last updated more than 25 years ago.
I have updated that style file to enable the use of url and doi.

## Installation
1. Simply download the file and put it in your AuthorKit folder
2. In your main tex file: `\bibliographystyle{newtheapa}`
3. ??????????
4. PROFIT !!!!!
